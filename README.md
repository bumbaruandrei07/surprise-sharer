# SurpriseSharer App 
#Devmind Academy Project
The purpose of the application is to obtain a generic system capable to:

- use multiple surprise types (i.e. implement a common interface);
- implement various algorithms for storing and giving surprises;
- use a powerful, random mechanism to generate a new set of surprises.
